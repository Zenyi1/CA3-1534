I added a traditional navbar using bootstrap, I will later change te colors and the design to make it fit the color scheme. I also created the visit.html page and the histry.html site. Th eindex.html file will serve as the home page.


I took a long time designing the home page, first I went to a website to makea css gradient with the color of the city flag to put in the background
Then I created the banner image with all the requirements. I added some general information about the city. Then I added pictures of local food that I mentioned and added the map from openmaps. I don't know if t counts as static since you can move it around, but it works. Then I used flexbox to align everything together. 

The visit page was very easy except for one thing. I followed the instructions and created a 7:5 column ratio and started adding content and images. For the bootstrap widgets I added cards to show infromation on the small amount of activities to do in the city, its nota touristic place so there are not many. But the left column was looking emptier so I added a cactus image using absolute position to the left corner. The challenge was that when I shrunk the website, the cactus was blocking content, so I searched onlne and found that using @media I  could make the image dissapear when the viewport shrunk, so afte adding that the visit page was finished.

Last but not least was teh history page, I added a decent amount of context and the makor things that happened in the city of Hermosillo, I included a cool colage of images of both new and old structures in the city as well as an image of the shield of the city. I decided to use a 2 column approach here as well mostly because I wanted to add images so that the user could look at something while reading. I ended up by adding links for a deeper dive at the bottom of the history page. I didn't have any major challenges in this section.
