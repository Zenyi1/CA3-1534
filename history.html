          <h2>History of Hermosillo, Sonora</h2>
          <p>
            Hermosillo is the capital city of the state of Sonora, Mexico. Its history dates back to the Spanish colonial period when it was founded in 1700. Originally established as a mission, Hermosillo has since grown into a bustling urban center with a rich cultural heritage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The city played a significant role in Mexico's struggle for independence from Spain. During the 19th century, it witnessed several battles and skirmishes as revolutionaries fought for freedom. Today, remnants of this turbulent past can still be seen in the city's architecture and landmarks.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most iconic landmarks in Hermosillo is the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a stunning example of Spanish colonial architecture. Visitors can explore its intricate designs and learn about its historical significance.

          <p>
            During the Mexican Revolution, beginning in 1910, forces loyal to Pancho Villa were expelled from the city by General Manuel M. Di√©guez.[4] After the assassination of Francisco I. Madero in 1913, Venustiano Carranza, then governor of Coahuila, sought refuge in Hermosillo. Here, Carranza began the Constitutionalist Movement. As a result, Hermosillo is nicknamed the "revolutionary capital of the country." A fun fact is that my grandma's parents ahd encounters with some of these revolutionary heroes and the american forces as well. They have some horrific stories about what both sides did during the war.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hermosillo was ranked as one of the five best cities to live in, in Mexico, as published in the study "The Most Livable Cities of Mexico 2013" by the Strategic Communications Cabinet of the Mexican Federal Government. Hermosillo was also ranked in 2016 as the seventh most competitive city in the country according to the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness (IMCO), based on factors such as its economic diversification, geographical location, access to education, government, innovation and international relations. The major manufacturing sector has been the production of automobiles since the 1980s. It is one of the richest cities in Mexico by GDP per capita.
